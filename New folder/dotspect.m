function [datahb]=dotspect(datamua,E)

% dotspect() performs spectroscopy on DOT <math>\frac{}{}\mu_a</math> data.
% 
% [datahb]=dotspect(datamua,E)
% 
% datamua is your absorption data, which must have a second-to-last
% dimension of color/wavelength. E is the spectroscopy matrix to use, which
% has dimensions wavelength x Hb contrast. If E is a square matrix, then
% the spectroscopy is performed with a simple matrix inversion. If E asks
% for fewer contrasts than there are wavelengths, then dotspect() should do
% a least-squares fitting, although this has never been tested. If there
% are more contrasts than wavelengths, the problem is obviously impossible
% to solve, resulting in an error.
